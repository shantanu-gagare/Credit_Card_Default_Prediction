# UCI Credit Card Default Prediction

Overview:
This project analyzes the UCI credit card default dataset, which contains information about credit card holders from an important bank in Taiwan for the period of April to September 2005. The dataset includes customer demographics, credit line information, payment history, bill amounts, and a binary target variable indicating default the following month.

Objective:
The goal of this project is to build predictive models to effectively predict credit card defaults and gain insights into customer behavior. Additionally, we explore potential business use cases for the predictive model.

Key Findings:

Several predictive models were trained, including a gradient boosting classifier, with good AUC-ROC scores.
Behavior in the past few months, especially the last month, is the strongest predictor of delinquency.
Credit limit is a reliable indicator of financial stability.
Careful consideration of precision-recall trade-offs is necessary for model optimization.
Recommendations:

Explore the possibility of treating this problem as a regression task to estimate the total amount of potential losses.
Consider using logistic regression, especially if model complexity can be reduced by eliminating irrelevant features.
Ensure the final model is not only accurate but also fast for practical deployment.
Data Source:
The dataset and this project are based on the research paper by Yeh, I. C., & Lien, C. H. (2009), "The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients."
